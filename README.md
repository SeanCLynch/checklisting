## :heavy_check_mark: Checklisting (for Tech)

Extreme complexity makes it easy to overlook routine matters during pressing circumstances (and moments of forgetfulness!). Formalizing these steps into a well-formatted series of actions, and making it easily accessible in all situations, are the key components of a good checklist.

A good checklist, with the proper team culture, can dramatically reduce the damage of careless, trivial errors in a project. Checklists have been used in aviation, construction, surgery, and more with outstanding results. 

> Checklisting (for tech) makes it easy to create, use, share, and iterate on checklists. 
> Checklisting is a principled, community-driven project.


## Features:
* Easily create checklists. Duh.
* Automatically (and optionally!) scan your checklist for best practices (e.g. number of items, simple wording, do-confirm vs read-do, etc). 
* Beautifully format your checklist for printing using the power of Latex. 
* Update, change and revise checklists with the community, based on real-world experiences.
* Or optionally create private checklists for secret things.
* Subscribe to curated articles on embracing a culture of teamwork and professional discipline.


## Sample use cases & examples:
* Forgotten a command while setting up a new machine?
* Missed a step while using version control?
* Forgotten an aspect of accessibility while writing HTML pages?
* More... (databases, pen testing, debugging(?), network config, etc)


## Roadmap/Todos:
1. Basic checklist creation on front-end.
2. Basic 'scanning for best practices' on back end. 
3. Design data structures / create models.
3. Intermediate latex-based formatting api.
4. Basic sharability and authorization/accounts.

__Best Practices:__
* killer items/stupid mistakes: only the most critical/important steps.
* keep it short: ~5-9 items recomended, single sheet of paper.
* easy to read: sans-serif, upper/lower case, avoid colors or graphics.
* authorize a reader: assign specific team member to initiate checklist use.


__Scripts/Commands/Magic Spells:__
* `> source bin/activate` opens the project.
